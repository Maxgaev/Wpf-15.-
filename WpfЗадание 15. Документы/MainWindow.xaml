                    BIM is a process for creating and managing information 
                    on a construction project throughout its whole life cycle. 
                    As part of this process, a coordinated digital description 
                    of every aspect of the built asset is developed, 
                    using a set of appropriate technology. 
                    It is likely that this digital description includes a combination 
                    of information-rich 3D models and associated structured 
                    data such as product, execution and handover information.

                                Knowledge of Building Information Modelling (BIM) 
                            within the construction industry is on the rise. 
                            The yearly reports produced by the National Building 
                            Standards (NBS) are a valuable resource 
                            for learning more about the rate of BIM adoption, 
                            both within a UK and international context.
                            For instance, NBS (2012, 2013) reports demonstrate 
                            the decrease in number of construction 
                            workers not aware of BIM, with 6% unaware in 2013, 
                            down from around 40% in 2011. This shows the rising 
                            knowledge of BIM, and possibly, its usefulness. 
                            \Other statistics show that in the earlier years, 
                            about 74% of the industry was not clear enough on 
                            what BIM was. Yet, by 2016 about 54% were aware
                            of and using BIM, with 42% at least aware of it, 
                            and just 4% neither aware of nor using BIM (NBS, 2016). 
                            Meaning knowledge of BIM has risen over time.
                            Regarding the future of BIM, 73% of participants 
                            agreed with the statement ‘BIM is the future of 
                            project information’. These statistics indicate that although 
                            some gaps are still present, knowledge of BIM continues to rise.
                            Realistically, awareness is not the only reason for 
                            adopting BIM in the AEC. However, awareness can 
                            influence policy changes to adopt BIM where necessary. 
                            In the UK for instance, awareness of BIM and its 
                            benefits has led to the government calling for BIM 
                            to be mandatory for public projects. 
                            This policy change has influenced 
                            the private sector to follow suit.

                                A core feature of working within a BIM environment is the drive towards encouraging multidisciplinary 
                                collaboration from the outset of a project. 
                                The benefits of all disciplines working together within one core BIM environment are substantial.
                                A major issue experienced within non-BIM design processes is the matter of conflicting design issues. 
                                The ethos of having a core central BIM model is to facilitate a smoother transition through these issues 
                                by identifying conflicts earlier on in the project stages, 
                                thus reducing the negative effects on schedule and costs.From an early stage, projects can be visualised, 
                                allowing client and designer alike to gain an appreciation of how the design is going to materialise. 
                                This allows for important design decisions and alterations to be made at an early stage, when the cost 
                                repercussions are small or even zero.

                                BIM technology has, over the years, helped in carrying
                                out all the pre-construction design analysis and interrogation,
                                resulting in reduction of conflicts and changes made during the
                                construction phase that usually have a detrimental effect on a
                                project in terms of wastage, quality, time and costs.
                                At the same time, the stringent energy analysis that can take
                                place in the early stages of a BIM project aims to improve the
                                performance of a project in regards to low-impact design.
                                Finally, post project completion, a high-quality BIM model can
                                continue to be utilised by an asset team to assist in the management of their assets in an efficient and environmentally conscious manner.
                                The efficiency of the effects of changes within documentation
                                or design is greatly improved as any changes made that are
                                linked to the main BIM package will automatically be carried
                                through and updated to all corresponding linked documents and models.

                                Having the design process completed within
                                a BIM environment using a core 3D BIM model
                                at the centre of the project can lead to
                                multiple benefits later in the process.
                                The models can be analysed, allowing for
                                a multitude of model interrogations to
                                take place, including energy analysis,
                                structural analysis, accurate schedules,
                                and quantity take-offs.
                                It is argued that using BIM processes
                                for building projects will improve energy
                                efficiency, improve scheduling, facilitate
                                a reduction of waste, and facilitate a reduction in costs.
